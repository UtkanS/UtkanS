# Hi, I am Utkan

Computer engineer and solo game developer. I build systems that are small, fast, and easy to read. Most of my work is in Unity and C#.

## Now
- Building a high-fantasy RPG in Unity as a solo dev
- Sharing small, focused C# utilities (one script at a time)

## What I enjoy
- Clean APIs and practical naming
- Data-driven design and mod-friendly tools
- Performance wins that do not hurt clarity

## Code samples
- [AdaptiveNumber](https://github.com/UtkanS/adaptive-number) â€” integer type that upgrades to BigInteger

## Tech
C#, Unity, .NET, LINQ, Addressables, BigInteger, Git
